# high-school
a collection of some of the stuff I wrote in high school

All code is written in C++ and Java.  Most of it is class assignments, with the exception of Game, an independent (unfinished) java project I created.  It's essentially an engine for a Pokemon-esque game run via command line (since I didn't know anything about GUIs).
