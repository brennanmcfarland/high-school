# high-school
a collection of some of the stuff I wrote in high school

All code is written in C++ and Java.  Most of it is class assignments, with the exception of Socrates (which I made in my spare time) and Game, an independent (unfinished) java project I created.  It's essentially an engine for a Pokemon-esque game run via command line (since I didn't know anything about GUIs).  Parts of it are incomplete, other parts are not currently in use by the Demo class, and some parts are currently broken, but it was a fun project and it gets the point across.  Provided as-is, with no guarantees of quality.
